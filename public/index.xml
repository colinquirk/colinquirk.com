      <description>Who are you? My name is Colin Quirk and I’m currently doing my PhD in Psychology in the Awh/Vogel lab at the University of Chicago.
 What is your background? I received my BA in cognitive neuroscience from Hampshire College, where I worked in Jane Couperus’s lab. This where I learned to do EEG research and gained an interest in visual working memory.
After graduating, I worked as a lab manager in Caren Rotello’s lab at UMASS Amherst.</description>
