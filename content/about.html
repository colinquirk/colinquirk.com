<h2>What is your background?</h2>
<p>I received my BA in cognitive neuroscience from Hampshire College, where I worked in Jane Couperus’s lab. This where I learned to do EEG research and gained an interest in visual working memory.</p>
<p>After graduating, I worked as a lab manager in Caren Rotello’s lab at UMASS Amherst. Together we worked on recognition memory using a combination of EEG, mTurk, and signal detection.</p>
